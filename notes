Bug with time zones: they don't change the date! So though TEDxYale starts before HackYale, it appears on the front end that it starts after because the date didn't go back when subtracting 5 hours from GMT. How should we fix?

I literally renamed most things. Pay attention to the changes; I think from now on all our html classnames should have hyphens, not underscores. filenames, variables and JS classes should continue to be named how they are.

Styling with float:left 's isn't scaleable or manageable. It's much better to use display: inline block. compare your previous feed-day (which was named something else in your code, probably). i moved the time block as a "left" div, and then the rest of the info as a right div. this also makes much more intuitive sense, instead of having odd margin-lefts every where and adjusting 3 numbers each time you want to change the design instead of 1.

Use variables in your Sass!!

Were you previously sorting the events somehow? I'm now doing it in the sort_and_group function in index.coffee, but it might better be done in the backend. i also don't know if you're doing it somewhere else...

The calendar is as functional as can be hoped for! For some reason, jQuery selectors aren't working nicely in backbone, but if you open up the console and run 
$(".cal-event[data_id='1']").addClass("overlap-2").addClass("overlap-order-0")
$(".cal-event[data_id='4']").addClass("overlap-2").addClass("overlap-order-1")

you'll see what I mean.

I think i just worked more than 12 hours straight...holy cow!
